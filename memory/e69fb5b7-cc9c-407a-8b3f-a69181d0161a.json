Here are a few highlights:\n\n1. **Health Platform**: I contributed to a health tech platform that enrolled over 2.3 million mothers, focusing on improving maternal health services. My role involved designing and building scalable backend systems using Python and cloud technologies.\n\n2. **Fintech Solution**: I worked on a fintech system that integrated mobile money and payment gateways. This project required a deep understanding of security protocols and data management to ensure seamless transactions for users.\n\n3. **AI-Powered Recruitment Platform**: In this project, I utilized technologies like Elasticsearch and NLP to create a recruitment platform that leverages machine learning for smarter talent matching. The integration of OpenAI also allowed us to enhance user interactions and recommendations.\n\n4. **Microservices Architecture**: I\u2019ve been part of initiatives that transitioned monolithic applications to microservices, enhancing scalability and maintainability. This involved using Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration.\n\nThese projects not only challenged me technically but also allowed me to work towards impactful solutions that serve millions of users. If you're interested in any specific technologies or methodologies I used, feel free to ask!",
